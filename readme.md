# 40 Commando
Welcome to the 40 Commando mod repo! If you are a member of the 40C and don't know what you're doing here, allow me to direct you back to the relative safety of the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GDWRvXD).
However, if you're an aspiring or current mod-maker, and wish to help the 40 Commando out with any wonderful thing you can think of, allow me to direct you too, to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GDWRvXD) and ask any of the staff members.

## Why does this exist?
1. To let us make custom tweaks and changes to existing content to suit our unit.
2. To replace the use of a Preset file for ensuring 40 Commando members have the right mods loaded (more on this later).

## How does this mod help with loading other mods?
We will use this mod as a dependency manager, of sorts. We will register all our core mods currently in the preset as dependencies to this mod. This means, whenever a member loads the mod, the Arma 3 Launcher will ensure the member has all the dependency mods loaded as well.

If you have any further questions, ask Arend(Saborknight) or any of the staff members on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GDWRvXD). Thank you for your wonderful time which I've just intentionally wasted.

## Setup for Development
1. Clone repo
1. Hopefully make and armake don't actually need to be downloaded by clients...
1. Download and install "make.exe" from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm (for Windows, normally from official site for Unix)
